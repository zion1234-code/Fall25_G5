## Product Vision
Our product is a mobile and web-based application that helps students discover, organize, and attend campus events. It provides a centralized place for clubs, faculty, and organizations to post events, while allowing students to filter by interest, RSVP, and receive reminders. This improves student engagement, promotes campus activities, and helps students feel more connected to their university community.
